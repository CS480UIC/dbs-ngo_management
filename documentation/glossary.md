### Handling plural attributes:   
> Entity: volunteer, Attribute: support_cause_id.  
A volunteer can choose to support multiple causes, which makes it a plural attribute. This was handled by creating a new dependent table volunteer_support_cause.    with composite primary key (volunteer_id, support_cause_id) which also act as foreign keys to entities volunteer and cause respectively.  

> Entity: donation, Attribute: donation_type.  
A donation transaction can include multiple types of donation, which makes it a plural attribute. This was handled by creating a new dependent table.    donation_donation_type with composite primary key (transaction_id, donation_type) and transaction_id acts as a foreign key to the donation entity.
